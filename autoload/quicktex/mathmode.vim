    " The rest of this function is for determining whether you're within $ $ or

    " be on a previous line. I'll try my best to explain. We're trying to
    " count the number of $ signs and the number of $$ signs from the
    " beginning of the document up to the cursor position. If either one of
    " these numbers is odd, then we must be in math mode. It's impossible that
    " they both be odd, as math modes cannot be nested. If we add these two
    " numbers together, we see that if the result is odd then one of the
    " summands was odd. If the result is even, then both of the summands must
    " have been even (as they can't both be odd). Instead of counting them
    " both separately and then adding them, though, we can count both of
    " them together at the same time. This reduces our search to a single
    " pass-through instead of two pass-throughs.

    " of these commands so that the string starts with a number. We also make
    " sure not to count \$'s. We check whether the user's .vimrc specifies the
